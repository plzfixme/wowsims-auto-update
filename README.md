This repository contains a Windows batch script that automatically checks and updates the WoWSims Mop simulator to the latest release from GitHub.
The script compares the locally installed version with the current GitHub release, downloads and extracts the update only if a new version is available, and then launches the application.

Use this tool to keep your WoWSims Mop installation always up to date automatically.

How to use:
Place both files (update.bat and version.txt) into any folder and run the .bat file. The script will check the current local version, compare it with the latest version from GitHub, and if necessary, download the new version and launch the updated executable automatically.
