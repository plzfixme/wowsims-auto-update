This repository contains a Windows batch script that automatically checks and updates the WoWSims Mop simulator to the latest release from GitHub.
The script compares the locally installed version with the current GitHub release, downloads and extracts the update only if a new version is available, and then launches the application.

Use this tool to keep your WoWSims Mop installation always up to date automatically.
